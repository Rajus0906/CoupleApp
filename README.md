# (APP NAME TBD)

I am building this app at because of the problem my significant other and I had where we would search for hours for a good app to track movies, games, and TV shows, and even plan date ideas, without constant ads, a paywall, or even making a Notion page (which tends to be a hassle at a point). We wanted something easy and convenient. So this app is for people who had the same issues as us. 

This app isn't restricted to just couples though; you can be friends, family, anyone who you want to share movies, shows or even game recommendations to, see how you both feel about something, or just wanting to stay connected with the people you love!!

## 📱 About The Project

My app is a mobile application built with **React Native** and **Expo**. It allows users to build a digital scrapbook of their shared entertainment experiences. Instead of just rating content individually, users can see what their partner or friends rated, leave comments, and unlock achievements based on their activity.

**Current Status:** *In Development (Frontend Phase)*

### Key Features (Implemented & Planned)
* **Profile System:** Customizable profiles with avatars, bio, and stats.
* **Media Tracking:** Rate and review movies, games, and TV shows.
* **Top 5 Favorites:** A dedicated section to showcase your all-time favorites.
* **Gamification:** Unlock "Medals" (like 'Couch Potato' or 'Critic') based on rating milestones.
* **Shared Views:** See your partner's ratings and compare stats.
* **Design:** Features a modern "Bento Box" card-style UI with a warm Beige/Brown aesthetic.
